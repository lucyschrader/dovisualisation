# Digital outreach at Te Papa
GLAMs are build on years of hard work collecting and describing objects, doing in-depth research, structuring and enriching data, creating beautiful and comprehensive digital representations, and connecting objects and people.

Platforms around the web provide different ways for people to access that work, anywhere. Even people who have never heard of Te Papa.

By understanding how these platforms work and who they reach, we find opportunities for the museum's collections and knowledge to have impacts that simply wouldn't happen inside our own (digital) walls.

Each channel we use for digital outreach does this differently â€“ some get in front of a massive audience of creators, others support doing deep scientific research, while some curate a virtual collection for a precisely targeted audience.
