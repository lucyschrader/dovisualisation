      <h2>Why Digital Outreach?</h2>
      <p>Platforms around the web provide different ways for people to access what a museum does, anywhere. Even people who have never heard of Te Papa.</p>
      <p>By understanding how these platforms work and who they reach, we find opportunities for the museum's collections and knowledge to have impacts that simply wouldn't happen inside our own (digital) walls.</p>
      <p>Each channel we use for digital outreach does this differently. Click around to see what we're doing!</p>
      <h3>Why the circles?</h3>

          <p>We think about platforms based on proximity, reach, and control.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Our own websites, with the most direct control over what gets shared (and how)</li>
            <li>Sites we directly contribute to, combining our material with other sources</li>
            <li>The wider world, with less control but chances to reach more people in new ways</li>
          </ol>
